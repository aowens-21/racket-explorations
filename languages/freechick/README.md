# FreeChick
Free the Chick is a game I made in Racket (in this repo) to learn about the language and Racket's GUI libraries. The purpose of this FreeChick language is to encapsulate many of the techniques from that game's source code into a concise and declarative format. This language is not broad, but can be used to recreate that game and a few other similar games.
